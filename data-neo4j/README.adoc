= Data load for Neo4j graph database

This folder contains steps and information for creating a free instance of Neo4j AuraDB and loading book, author, and review data into it.

== Creating Neo4j instance with AuraDB free

* Sign up and choose to create a https://bit.ly/neo4j-aura[free instance of AuraDB^].

== Load the data into Neo4j

Our 10,000 book data set is a bit too large for Neo4j AuraDB free tier instance size. However, the limited size is expected to upgrade in the next month or two. ;)

In the meantime, we can trim our Neo4j data set down just a bit as a temporary solution.

* Click on the `Query` button for the running instance to open Neo4j Browser.
* Copy/paste first section of `create_goodreads.cypher` (indexes) into the input box at the top and click the `play` button icon.
* Copy/paste the rest of the `create_goodreads.cypher` file into the input box at the top and click the `play` button icon.

*Note:* If you would like to load the full 10,000 book data set, you can do so with AuraDB Pro tier, which costs around $130/month.
This choice is entirely up to you.
The data set and import statements for this are in the https://github.com/JMHReif/graph-demo-datasets/tree/main/goodreadsUCSD[graph-demo-datasets^] repository on Github.

== Verify the data

We can verify the data with the same tool we used to load it - Neo4j Browser (query editor).
The following queries are some examples:

** View the data model

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.meta.graph();
----

** Find some books

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (b:Book)
RETURN b LIMIT 50;
----

** Find books and their authors

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (b:Book)<-[r:AUTHORED]-(a:Author)
RETURN * LIMIT 50;
----

** Find some books with their related authors and reviews

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Author)-[rel:AUTHORED]->(b:Book)<-[rel2:WRITTEN_FOR]-(r:Review)
RETURN * LIMIT 50;
----
